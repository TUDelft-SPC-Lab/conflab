# Preprocessing scripts

The Conflab dataset contains both raw and processed data.

The scripts in these folders were used to preprocess the raw data into the processed files. The data produced by these scripts is therefore already provided with the dataset. We provide the code for users who might want to preprocess the raw files in different ways.
